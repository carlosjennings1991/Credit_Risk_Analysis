# Credit Risk Analysis

In this analysis, we review the likelihood of a borrower defaultingo on a loan. Using several variables as inputs, we test several sampling and classification techniques to find the best predictor. For each method, we rely on three key metrics. 

*# Precision
*# Sensitivity (aka 'Recall')
*# Accuracy

These metrics bear some explanation, especially since precision and accuracy are nearly interchangeable in everyday speech.
